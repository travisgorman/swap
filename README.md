Elevator pitch:
A social app for connecting with others to trade knowledge and share skills.

That could probably use some work.

The general idea is to connect someone who wants to learn a thing with someone willing to teach that thing.

Before I got to TIY, after deciding to learn JavaScript, I was frustrated with the fact that I wasn't easily able to find someone to come over and give me a hand. I thought it should be easy enough to find a tutor online through craigslist or something like that, and was finding that not to be the case. So I had a "There should be an 'Uber of...' for that".

Now that I've looked into it a bit more, I'm finding that there are plenty of tutor matching services, but they all seem very transactional, and tied into college campus' and standardized tests. I'm thinking more along the lines of general self-improvement or useful/valuable skills type education. These 'social economy' type sites have a huge potential to build real communities, that get lost when things get transactional.

I've been pretty active on Couchsurfing.org since 2011 or so. One thing Couchsurfing.org sort of prides itself on is that it's not AirBnB. No money changes hands. The social aspect is the only currency. Yet a real demand is supplied. And it's usually win win. I've taken in 50 or so (groups of) surfers - it's almost always been a good time. Unlike AirBnB, you don't hole up in your room, or treat the place like a hotel. I've made tons of friends all over the world from Couchsurfing. I don't remember the names of anyone I've met on AirBnB.

If some kind of barter/social market like this existed for education, people could enrich their lives by learning a particular skill while also getting the opportunity to teach something. Instead of paying cash for flute lessons, they have to teach their tutor how to juggle, or twerk or edit their resume, or whatever. People end up learning new things they didn't even know they wanted to learn. Theres an aspect of discovery and stepping outside ones bubble here. And friendships are formed.

The reason this doesn't already exist is probably because it's way more niche than something as universal as travel/lodging. So it might not be a viable business, but I it would make for a good project.

The basic functionality: a user has a profile, detailing particular skills they may have. They could then search for something they have interest in learning, and other users would be offered for them to initiate contact with. Pretty simple concept, but there are tons of additional features that can be added.

On couchsurfing, the commonality everyone shares is traveling. Here, the one thing that unites everyone is that users value self-education, self-improvement, and taking an active role in learning new things. Users see learning a new skill as an important investment they can make in themselves. Everyone gets the benefit of learning and teaching.
